They treated me extremely well, and taught me how to produce professional websites. The company has since grown to about 10 employees, and now specialises in making highly advanced web applications. It's cutting edge stuff, with a team that loves it and I count myself lucky to have been a part of it. It was been during my time at Kintek that I developed a real passion for Software Development, and the web as a platform.</p></li><li><a href="#" class="read-more">more info...</a>2008 - 2009: University of Queensland.

The course covered topics such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, JSP, Oracle, MySQL and making basic web apps. It was a relatively easy subject for a lot of students but I believed it was a good, practical course unlike a lot of the other subjects I took.</p></li><li><a href="#" class="read-more">more info...</a>2001 - 2005: Daily Mercury.

Here is a reference. My main role was to provide technical support to the staff. My boss, the sysadmin was a real pro and I learned plenty about troubleshooting, networking and computer hardware. I also gained a bit of insight into the print industry.</p></li></ul></section><section id="skills"><h1><i class="fa fa-html5"></i> Mad Skills</h1><div class="columns"><p>I love learning new technologies and programming languages.
