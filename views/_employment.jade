      p.hidden When I joined Kintek there were only two staff members (my bosses). They treated me extremely well, and taught me how to produce professional websites.

      | 2008 - 2009: University of Queensland. Tutor (Web Information Systems)
      p.hidden At University I worked as a tutor for a third year Web Information Systems course (INFS3202), and even received a tutoring excellence award which I was pretty proud of. The course covered topics such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, JSP, Oracle, MySQL and making basic web apps. It was a relatively easy subject for a lot of students but I believed it was a good, practical course unlike a lot of the other subjects I took.
